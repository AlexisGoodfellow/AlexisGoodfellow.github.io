        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p>My name is Alexis Goodfellow. This is my website. It doesn't look pretty, but
        it tells you what you need to know - just like a good design spec.</p>

        <p>I graduated Tufts University with a degree in Computer Science in 2018,
        where I took particular interest in systems design, embedded systems, and
        cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>Soon after graduation, I worked at Arista Networks for half a year on their
        IPSec project. My job in particular was to design a testing suite to ensure
        that our implementation of the protocol was not just secure, but also could
        provide the 10 gigabit-per-second throughput we advertized. It was a career goal
        of mine to be involved in writing code that would help keep the Internet
        secure, reliable, and efficient; I'm very fortunate to have been afforded that
        opportunity so early in my career.</p>

        <p>I then joined Wayfair through their Labs program, and was placed on a permanent
        team after the Labs program was over. The team I was placed on was called
        "International Supply Chain - Ocean Operations", which basically meant that I
        wrote code to automate some of the tedious logistics associated with routing
        shipping containers across the ocean on cargo ships. Learning about the business
        aspects of supply chain was very interesting, but I soon concluded that it was
        not something I would be happy with in the longrun.</p>

        <p>I then internally transfered to the Python Platform team, which is my current job.
        Our goal as a team is to develop scalable Python architecture for the entire company
        and serve as subject matter experts in Python programming. We set the coding practices
        and standards for Python at the organization, and we maintain several core libraries
        that are used throughout the company. We strive to make the process of taking an
        idea for a project and making it into a production service as painless and frictionless
        as possible. This kind of DevOps work and focus on ensuring other engineers have an
        easier time leveraging company infrastructure is something I could see myself being
        happy with for a long time.</p>

        <p>I also do talks at some of the local Universities. I've lead a workshop about Vim
        on multiple occasions, such as at a Wellseley College hackathon, at the Tufts University
        Women in Tech conference, and internally at Wayfair for the entire Quality Assurance/
        Quality Engineering branch of the organization. I am also a leader of Wayfair's
        trans-in-tech employee resource group, which provides policy information, guidance,
        and advocacy for transgender technologists at Wayfair.</p>
