Welcome!

My name is Alexis Goodfellow. This is my website. It doesn't look pretty, but
it tells you what you need to know - just like a good design spec.

I graduated Tufts University with a degree in Computer Science in 2018,
where I took particular interest in systems design, embedded systems, and
cybersecurity.

Soon after graduation, I worked at Arista Networks for half a year on their
IPSec project. My job in particular was to design a testing suite to ensure
that our implementation of the protocol was not just secure, but also could
provide the 10 gigabit-per-second throughput we advertized. It was a career goal
of mine to be involved in writing code that would help keep the Internet
secure, reliable, and efficient; I'm very fortunate to have been afforded that
opportunity so early in my career.

I then joined Wayfair through their Labs program, and was placed on a permanent
team after the Labs program was over. The team I was placed on was called
"International Supply Chain - Ocean Operations", which basically meant that I
wrote code to automate some of the tedious logistics associated with routing
shipping containers across the ocean on cargo ships. Learning about the business
aspects of supply chain was very interesting, but I soon concluded that it was
not something I would be happy with in the longrun.

I then internally transfered to the Python Platform team, which is my current job.
Our goal as a team is to develop scalable Python architecture for the entire company
and serve as subject matter experts in Python programming. We set the coding practices
and standards for Python at the organization, and we maintain several core libraries
that are used throughout the company. We strive to make the process of taking an
idea for a project and making it into a production service as painless and frictionless
as possible. This kind of DevOps work and focus on ensuring other engineers have an
easier time leveraging company infrastructure is something I could see myself being
happy with for a long time.

I also do talks at some of the local Universities. I've lead a workshop about Vim
on multiple occasions, such as at a Wellseley College hackathon, at the Tufts University
Women in Tech conference, and internally at Wayfair for the entire Quality Assurance/
Quality Engineering branch of the organization. I am also a leader of Wayfair's
trans-in-tech employee resource group, which provides policy information, guidance,
and advocacy for transgender technologists at Wayfair.
