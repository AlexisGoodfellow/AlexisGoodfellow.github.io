        <h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>

        <p>My name is Alexis Goodfellow. This is my website. It doesn't look pretty, but
        it tells you what you need to know - just like a good design spec.</p>

        <h2>College Days</h2>

        <p>I graduated Tufts University with a degree in Computer Science in 2018,
        where I took particular interest in systems design, embedded systems, and
        cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>The culmination of my study of cybersecurity was a paper
        on the subject of quantum cryptographic key distribution (QKD) protocols. These
        protocols have inherent advantages over classical cryptographic algorithms
        when it comes to security, but all current implementations of them have
        physical flaws which can be exploited to undermine the theoretically perfect
        security they provide. Furthermore, there are significant logistical challenges
        regarding signal loss over fiber-obtic cables, which means that quantum information
        decays too quickly for it to be practical to use QKD across long distances.</p>

        <p>Though these QKD algorithms and systems are not currently viable as
        security solutions for most due to both expense and impracticality, there are
        a few organizations, universities, and government institutions that are currently
        using on-premises short-range QKD networks. Much progress is being made on making this
        technology both more practical and more affordable, and the subject is being actively
        researched by physicists and computer scientists alike from all across the world.</p>

        <p><a href="https://alexisgoodfellow.github.io/documents/qkd.pdf">
            Here is a link to the paper if you are curious about reading more about QKD
        </a></p>

        <p><a href="https://alexisgoodfellow.github.io/documents/dqkd.pdf">
            Here is a link to a follow-up paper I wrote proposing a distributed QKD implementation (still a draft)
        </a></p>

        <p>There are two other projects from my college years which are worthy of note.
        The first of these projects is Composte, which currently is a proof-of-concept
        project aiming to be a networked and distributed sheet music editor. This project
        is incredibly mature for a college project, and uses the impressive music21 library
        maintained by the wonderful music department at MIT.</p>

        <p>The second project worthy of note is a project called WinfreyEdit, which is
        a multi-user text editor. The project is no longer actively maintained and does
        not see any use, but it has an interesting latency-sensitive implementation.
        Using some analysis of per-packet round-trip times, WinfreyEdit was designed
        to dynamically adjust the update frequency of the shared document based on the lag
        time of the contributor with the worst internet connection.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/AlexisGoodfellow?tab=repositories">
            The source code of both of these projects - and this website itself - can be found on my personal GitHub page
        </a>

        <h2>Post-College Career</h2>

        <p>Soon after graduation, I worked at Arista Networks for half a year on their
        IPSec project. My job in particular was to design a testing suite to ensure
        that our implementation of the protocol was not just secure, but also could
        provide the 10 gigabit-per-second throughput we advertized. It was a personal goal
        of mine to be involved in writing code that would help keep the Internet
        secure, reliable, and efficient; I'm very fortunate to have been afforded that
        opportunity so early in my career.</p>

        <p>I then joined Wayfair through their Labs program, and was placed on a permanent
        team after the Labs program was over. The team I was placed on was called
        "International Supply Chain - Ocean Operations", which basically meant that I
        wrote code to automate some of the tedious logistics associated with routing
        shipping containers across the ocean on cargo ships. Learning about the business
        aspects of supply chain was very interesting, but I soon concluded that it was
        not something I would be happy with in the longrun.</p>

        <p>I then internally transfered to the Python Platform team, which is my current job.
        Our goal as a team is to develop scalable Python architecture for the entire company
        and serve as subject matter experts in Python programming. We set the coding practices
        and standards for Python at the organization, and we maintain several core libraries
        that are used throughout the company. We strive to make the process of taking a new
        project from proof-of-concept to production-ready service as painless and frictionless
        as possible. This kind of DevOps work is something I could see myself being
        happy with for a long time.</p>

        <p>I also do talks at some of the local universities and colleges around Boston.
        I've lead a workshop about Vim on multiple occasions, such as at the 2019
        Wellesley College hackathon (WHACK), at the 2019 Tufts University Women in Tech
        (WiT) conference, and internally at Wayfair for the entire
        Quality Assurance/Quality Engineering branch of the organization.</p>

            This is the slide deck for my Vim talk
        </a>

        <p>Additionally, I am a co-leader of Wayfair's trans-in-tech employee resource group,
        which provides policy information, guidance, and advocacy for transgender technologists
        at Wayfair.</p>
